# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It was really fun to learn about classes although some of the syntax is really frustrating at times. Overall it was quite a nice change of pace to learn some things on my own.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I might not be taking enough breaks but I usually don't mind pushing myself a little harder when my mind is in work hard mode.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I honestly feel completely ready now, I'm not sure if that will hold up long term but I hope it will.
